## 🛠 Types of Vulnerabilities That Matter

Since this project is a **static website**, relevant security concerns might include:

- JavaScript injection or DOM-based XSS
- Misconfigurations in forms or external integrations (if any)
- Exposed environment files or secrets (we do not include them here)
- Broken links or insecure third-party embeds

## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please **do not open a public issue.**  
Instead, report it confidentially via:

📧 Email: **[developer.dikefxstudio@gmail.com]**

Please include:

- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Your GitHub handle (if you'd like credit for responsible disclosure)

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:

- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations or disruption
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before disclosing it publicly
- Refrain from testing against production without permission (e.g. spam forms, denial of service)

## 🛡 Credits

We appreciate ethical hackers and security researchers who help us improve. If your report leads to a confirmed fix, we’ll happily credit you (unless you prefer anonymity).
